        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lemonade and cucumber juice pair perfectly in this refreshing homemade summer drink. Serve in the pitcher with cucumber and lemon slices.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, sliced</li>
            <li>6 lemons, juiced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make the simple syrup: Combine water and sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat; heat until just about to boil and sugar has dissolved. Place in refrigerator until cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Blend cucumber in a blender or food processor until mashed into a pulp. Pour cucumber pulp into a fine mesh strainer placed over a bowl; allow to sit until you have about 2/3 cup of cucumber juice in the bowl, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir simple syrup, cucumber juice, and lemon juice together in a pitcher. Serve cold.</li>
