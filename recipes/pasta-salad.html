        make the cooking process easier:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If you’re making your own pesto, Kathryn says, you can use any nut or seed you want instead of pine nuts
            (such as walnuts or pepitas).</li>
        <li>Make it a protein-packed main course by adding cooked chicken or (drained) chickpeas. </li>
        <li>Rinse pasta in cold water to cool it quickly and keep it from cooking further from residual heat, recommends
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/author/juliana-hale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juliana
                Hale</a>. If the pasta is warm, it can wilt the arugula and tomatoes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Store the pesto pasta salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. This actually
